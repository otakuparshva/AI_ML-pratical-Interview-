Task to be performed:
1.	Understand the data
•	Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.
•	Question 1: When reviewing the df.info() output, what do you notice about the different variables? Are there any null values? Are all of the variables numeric? Does anything else stand out?
-	Answer:  
-	Data types are :  float64(8), int64(7), object(3)
-	No there is no Null Values 
-	The dataset contains 22,699 records, with all the variables populated, as there are no null values in the data.
-	The Unnamed: 0 column seems to be an index or identifier, which should likely be dropped as it doesn't provide any useful information for analysis.
-	The VendorID, RatecodeID, PULocationID, DOLocationID, and Payment_type columns are categorical in nature, with numerical encoding, while others like Trip_distance, Fare_amount, Tip_amount, Tolls_amount, etc., are continuous numerical variables.









•	Question 2: When reviewing the df.describe() output, what do you notice about the distributions of each variable? Are there any questionable values?
-	Answer:  
-	I notice that trip distance min is 0 which is likely invalid
-	I fare amount also the min is around -120 which is in negative which detect to anomaly
-	The tip values show a lot of variation, with an average of 1.83, indicating some extreme outliers in tip amounts.
-	There is some extra charge in negative which is also a thing because it should in positive 
-	 The total fare reaches 999.99, which seems unusually high and could be an outlier or error in the data.









•	Write a compiled summary information about the data to inform next steps. 
-	Answer:
-	There are 22699 records 
-	18 columns of different categories 
-	   1. Numeric data : like trip distance , fare amount and total amount
-	   2. Integer data : like number of passenger ,payment type and some location IDs
-	3. Text data : Like pick and drop time and flags 
-	There are no missing values
-	There is problem in Unnamed Column , Negative value in Fare amount , Zero trip Distance , Outliers in Total Amount 
                    








2.	Understand the variables
•	Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into specific variables.
•	Sort and interpret the data table for two variables: trip_distance and total_amount. Answer the following three questions:
•	Question 1: Sort your first variable (trip_distance) from maximum to minimum value, do the values seem normal?
-	Answer:
-	After sorting trip distance from max to min value seems normal 
-	This head(10) values : 
-	   trip distance
-	9280           33.96
-	13861          33.92
-	6064           32.72
-	10291          31.95
-	29             30.83
-	18130          30.50
-	5792           30.33
-	15350          28.23
-	10302          28.20
-	2592           27.97
•	But Some Min trip distance is  like 0.0 could indicate erroneous records or trips where no actual movement occurred, possibly due to technical issues or cancelled rides.
•	This is tail()
 trip_distance
20042            0.0
4910             0.0
3865             0.0
5630             0.0






•	Question 2: Sort by your second variable (total_amount), are any values unusual?
-	Answer:
-	Yes, are unusual data in total amount which Negative amounts which leads to anomaly 
-	       total amount
-	8476        1200.29
-	20312        450.30
-	13861        258.21
-	12511        233.74
-	15474        211.80
-	...             ...
-	11204         -5.30
-	14714         -5.30
-	20698         -5.80
-	17602         -5.80
-	12944       -120.30
•	Here we can see negative amount goes up to -120 





•	Question 3: Are the resulting rows similar for both sorts? Why or why not?
-	Answer: The sorted rows for trip distance and total amount may not be directly comparable because the total fare is influenced by multiple factors such as distance, tolls, time, and rate codes, whereas the trip distance is just the physical distance of the trip. Thus, even if a trip has a high distance, the fare may not be correspondingly high if other factors (like rate codes or payment type) are different.






3.	Develop a machine learning (regression) model
•	What is the error in prediction?
-	Answer:
-	Error Metrics:
-	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.013949490923875861
-	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.027297496227734582
-	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.16521953948529994
-	There is  error but very least  




•	What is the percentage of accuracy in prediction?
-	Answer:  Accuracy Percentage: 99.99435882430187%
